Analytical Questions
The data warehouse must be designed to answer the following questions through SQL queries:

1. How has sales per capita changed over time?
- Requires joining grocery sales, population data, and time dimensions
- Calculate sales per capita by municipality and time period

2. Is there a correlation between sales and tourism statistics?
- Analyze relationship between tourism visitor counts/revenue and grocery sales
- Consider temporal alignment (monthly tourism vs daily sales)
==
- Are monthly sales per capita different (is difference within months smaller tham between)? -ANOVA
- Are monthly visits different? - ANOVA
- If both are, do they correlate? Two curves (averages) with 12 points?


3. Which municipalities have the highest sales per capita, and how does this relate to tourism?
- Compare sales per capita across municipalities
- Investigate correlation with tourism metrics
==
- Are sales per capita different accross municipalities? - ANOVA
- Switch municipality to place of month 


4. What are the seasonal patterns in both tourism and grocery sales?
- Identify seasonal trends and patterns
- Compare tourism seasonality with sales seasonality

5. How do different product categories perform across municipalities?
- Analyze product category sales by location
- Identify regional preferences or patterns
==
- category, municipality => sales
- Are sales of one category different accross municipalities (diff within category vs diff between munis)? - ANOVA
- If so, what are the munis that stand out?


6. Which stores are the top performers, and what factors contribute to their success?
- Store-level performance analysis
- Investigate factors like location, municipality, size
==
- We really only know municipality, so can't differentiate stores


7. How has tourism revenue changed over time by municipality?
- Time-series analysis of tourism trends
- Municipality-level comparisons
==
Yearly trends in revenue (per capita?) for municipalities
- good for graphs: 16 curves criss-crossing


8. What is the relationship between population size and total grocery sales?
- Demographic correlation analysis
- Population growth vs sales growth
==
- municipality size vs total sales: scatter plot, linear regression
- for single municipalities: two curves on years, population and sales 


9. Are there differences in sales patterns between weekdays and weekends?
- Temporal pattern analysis
- Day-of-week effects on sales

10. How do product category sales correlate with tourism seasons?
- Cross-domain correlation analysis
- Seasonal product preferences during tourism peaks
